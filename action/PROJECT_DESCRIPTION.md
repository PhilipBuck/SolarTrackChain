# SolarTrackChain - Project Description

SolarTrackChain is a decentralized application built on FHEVM v0.9 that enables users to track solar energy usage on the blockchain with complete privacy through fully homomorphic encryption. Users can securely log daily energy consumption in encrypted form while still enabling aggregate statistics and global calculations. The platform features daily usage logging, leaderboards, user profiles with achievement badges, and streak tracking. Built with Solidity smart contracts and Next.js, SolarTrackChain demonstrates how blockchain and advanced cryptography can create privacy-preserving solutions for renewable energy tracking.
